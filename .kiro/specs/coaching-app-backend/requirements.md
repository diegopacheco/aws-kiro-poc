# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a coaching application backend built with Go, Gin Gonic framework, and MySQL database. The backend will provide REST API endpoints to support team management and feedback functionality for a coaching platform. The system will handle team member management, team creation, team assignments, and feedback collection with a focus on simplicity and reusability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a coach, I want to add team members with their details, so that I can build and manage my coaching roster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to add a team member THEN the system SHALL accept name, picture, and email fields
2. WHEN team member data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate that name and email are required fields
3. WHEN a team member is successfully created THEN the system SHALL return the created team member with a unique ID
4. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN a GET request is made for team members THEN the system SHALL return a list of all team members

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a coach, I want to create teams with identifying information, so that I can organize my coaching groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to create a team THEN the system SHALL accept team name and team logo fields
2. WHEN team data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate that team name is a required field
3. WHEN a team is successfully created THEN the system SHALL return the created team with a unique ID
4. WHEN invalid team data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN a GET request is made for teams THEN the system SHALL return a list of all teams

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a coach, I want to assign team members to teams, so that I can organize people into coaching groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to assign a person to a team THEN the system SHALL accept team member ID and team ID
2. WHEN assignment data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate that both team member and team exist
3. WHEN a valid assignment is made THEN the system SHALL create the relationship between team member and team
4. WHEN an invalid assignment is attempted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN a GET request is made for team assignments THEN the system SHALL return team members grouped by teams

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a coach, I want to give feedback to teams or individual team members, so that I can provide guidance and track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to give feedback THEN the system SHALL accept feedback content and target (team or person)
2. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate that feedback content is provided
3. WHEN feedback targets a team THEN the system SHALL associate feedback with the specified team ID
4. WHEN feedback targets a person THEN the system SHALL associate feedback with the specified team member ID
5. WHEN feedback is successfully created THEN the system SHALL return the created feedback with timestamp and unique ID
6. WHEN a GET request is made for feedback THEN the system SHALL return feedback filtered by target type and ID

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want REST endpoints that follow consistent patterns, so that the API is predictable and easy to integrate with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return responses in consistent JSON format
2. WHEN successful operations occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201)
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error status codes (400, 404, 500)
4. WHEN endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL support CORS for frontend integration
5. WHEN the API is running THEN the system SHALL expose endpoints following RESTful conventions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to be easily buildable and runnable, so that deployment and development workflows are streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build script is executed THEN the system SHALL compile the Go application successfully
2. WHEN the run script is executed THEN the system SHALL start the backend server on a specified port
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish connection to MySQL database
4. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN the application is built THEN all code SHALL be contained within the /backend folder
