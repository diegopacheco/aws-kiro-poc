# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing coaching application with improved user experience, better API integration, comprehensive feedback management, team administration capabilities, and streamlined build processes. These improvements build upon the existing backend, frontend, and infrastructure components to provide a more complete and polished coaching platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend user, I want forms to communicate with the backend API instead of local storage, so that data is properly persisted and shared across sessions.

3. WHEN I submit feedback THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to the backend API
4. WHEN I assign a member to a team THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to the backend API
5. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
6. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL fetch existing data from the backend APIs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a coach, I want to see all feedback in one place with filtering options, so that I can review and analyze feedback patterns across teams and individuals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the feedback list page THEN the system SHALL display all feedback entries
2. WHEN I want to filter feedback THEN the system SHALL provide options to filter by team member or team

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a coach, I want a team management interface where I can view team compositions and make changes, so that I can maintain and organize my teams effectively.

6. WHEN I make changes THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect updates in the interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback when I perform actions, so that I know my actions were successful and the system is responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I successfully give feedback THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification for 3 seconds
2. WHEN I successfully create a team THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification for 3 seconds
3. WHEN I successfully add a team member THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification for 3 seconds
4. WHEN I successfully assign a member to a team THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification for 3 seconds
5. WHEN I successfully remove a member from a team THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification for 3 seconds
6. WHEN I successfully delete a team THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification for 3 seconds
7. WHEN toast notifications appear THEN the system SHALL NOT use browser alert dialogs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the application branding consistently, so that the interface feels professional and cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN the logo loads THEN the system SHALL maintain proper aspect ratio and sizing
4. WHEN the header is rendered THEN the system SHALL position the logo prominently and consistently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified build process, so that I can easily build all components of the application with a single command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN I run the build-all script THEN the system SHALL build the frontend React application
3. WHEN I run the build-all script THEN the system SHALL build all Docker images for the application stack
4. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear success or failure feedback
5. WHEN build errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages for debugging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a frontend user, I want current data to be available immediately when I use the application, so that I can see the most up-to-date information without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch all teams from the API
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch all feedback from the API
