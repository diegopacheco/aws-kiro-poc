# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a complete Docker-based infrastructure setup for the coaching application. The system needs to containerize the frontend, backend, and database components, providing a seamless development and deployment experience with persistent data storage and proper orchestration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the entire coaching application stack with a single command, so that I can quickly set up the development environment without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs a start script THEN the system SHALL start all three services (frontend, backend, database) automatically
2. WHEN the application stack starts THEN the system SHALL ensure proper service dependencies and startup order
3. WHEN the stack is running THEN the system SHALL provide access to the frontend, backend API, and database
4. WHEN a developer stops the stack THEN the system SHALL gracefully shut down all services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database to be automatically initialized with the proper schema, so that I don't need to manually create tables and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MySQL container starts THEN the system SHALL automatically execute the database schema creation
2. WHEN the schema is created THEN the system SHALL include all necessary tables for teams, team members, assignments, and feedback
3. WHEN the database initializes THEN the system SHALL create proper relationships and constraints between tables
4. WHEN the backend connects THEN the system SHALL have a fully functional database ready for operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database data to persist between container restarts, so that I don't lose development data when stopping and starting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MySQL container is stopped and restarted THEN the system SHALL retain all existing data
2. WHEN the database volume is mapped THEN the system SHALL store data in a local directory outside the container
3. WHEN the local data directory exists THEN the system SHALL be excluded from version control
4. WHEN containers are recreated THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each application component to be properly containerized, so that the application runs consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend is containerized THEN the system SHALL build and serve the React application
2. WHEN the backend is containerized THEN the system SHALL compile and run the Go application with proper dependencies
3. WHEN containers are built THEN the system SHALL optimize for development workflow and rebuild efficiency
4. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL use proper networking and service discovery

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and scripts for managing the infrastructure, so that I can easily understand and maintain the Docker setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL include clear setup and usage instructions
2. WHEN scripts are created THEN the system SHALL provide simple commands for common operations
3. WHEN the README is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect the new Docker-based workflow
4. WHEN developers onboard THEN the system SHALL provide all necessary information for getting started

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the infrastructure to support both development and production workflows, so that the same setup can be used across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL support different configurations for dev/prod
2. WHEN the setup is production-ready THEN the system SHALL include proper security and performance considerations
3. WHEN services are configured THEN the system SHALL use appropriate ports and networking for each environment
4. WHEN the stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL be scalable and maintainable
