# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create database schema and initialization setup
  - Create `db/` directory in project root
  - Write `db/schema.sql` with complete database schema including teams, team_members, team_assignments, and feedback tables
  - Add `db/mysql_data/` to `.gitignore` for persistent data storage
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Create backend Dockerfile with multi-stage build
  - Write `backend/Dockerfile` with Go build stage and lightweight runtime stage
  - Configure proper Go module handling and dependency installation
  - Add health check endpoint and expose port 8080
  - Optimize for development workflow and rebuild efficiency
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 6.3_

- [x] 3. Create frontend Dockerfile with Bun setup
  - Write `frontend/Dockerfile` with Bun package manager and development server
  - Configure multi-stage build for development and production
  - Set up hot reloading support and expose port 3000
  - Handle React build process and static file serving
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 6.3_

- [x] 4. Implement Docker Compose orchestration
  - Create root-level `docker-compose.yml` with all three services
  - Configure service dependencies and startup order (database → backend → frontend)
  - Set up proper networking between services with service discovery
  - Map volumes for database persistence and development source code
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Create startup script and documentation
  - Write `start.sh` script to orchestrate full stack startup
  - Make script executable and add proper error handling
  - Update `README.md` with Docker setup instructions and usage
  - Document environment variables and configuration options
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Configure environment variables and production readiness
  - Set up environment variable configuration for different environments
  - Configure database connection strings and service URLs
  - Add security considerations and production optimizations
  - Ensure proper port mapping and networking for deployment
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 7. Test complete infrastructure setup and integration
  - Verify all containers build successfully without errors
  - Test service startup order and dependency management
  - Validate database initialization and schema creation
  - Test data persistence across container restarts
  - Verify frontend-backend-database connectivity and API operations
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, 4.4_
