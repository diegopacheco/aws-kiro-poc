# Design Document

## Overview

The coaching application frontend will be a single-page React application built with TypeScript and Bun. The application will use local state management and focus on component reusability. The architecture will be simple and straightforward, avoiding over-engineering while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun (latest)
- **Language**: TypeScript (latest)
- **Framework**: React (latest)
- **Build Tool**: Bun's built-in bundler
- **Styling**: CSS Modules or styled-components for component-scoped styles

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Data Types
```typescript
interface TeamMember {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  picture?: string;
  teamIds: string[];
}

interface Team {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  logo?: string;
  memberIds: string[];
}

interface Feedback {
  id: string;
  recipientType: 'team' | 'member';
  recipientId: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Component Hierarchy

#### Common Components
- `Button` - Reusable button with variants
- `Input` - Text input with validation
- `FileUpload` - Image upload with preview
- `Card` - Container component for content sections
- `Modal` - Overlay component for dialogs
- `Navigation` - Main navigation component

#### Form Components
- `TeamMemberForm` - Form for adding team members
- `TeamForm` - Form for creating teams
- `AssignmentForm` - Form for assigning members to teams
- `FeedbackForm` - Form for submitting feedback

#### Page Components
- `AddTeamMemberPage` - Page for adding new team members
- `CreateTeamPage` - Page for creating new teams
- `AssignToTeamPage` - Page for team assignments
- `GiveFeedbackPage` - Page for providing feedback
- `HomePage` - Landing page with navigation options

### State Management
- Use React's built-in `useState` and `useContext` for state management
- Create custom hooks for data operations (useTeamMembers, useTeams, useFeedback)
- Store data in localStorage for persistence between sessions

## Data Models

### Local Storage Schema
```typescript
interface AppState {
  teamMembers: TeamMember[];
  teams: Team[];
  feedback: Feedback[];
}
```

### Data Operations
- CRUD operations for team members, teams, and feedback
- Assignment operations for linking members to teams
- Search and filter capabilities for large datasets

## Error Handling

### Validation Strategy
- Form validation using built-in HTML5 validation
- Custom validation hooks for complex business rules
- Real-time validation feedback to users

### Error States
- Display validation errors inline with form fields
- Show loading states during file uploads
- Handle missing data gracefully with empty states

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- Unit tests for individual components using React Testing Library
- Integration tests for form submissions and data flow
- Snapshot tests for UI consistency

### User Experience Testing
- Manual testing of all user flows
- Responsive design testing across different screen sizes
- Accessibility testing for keyboard navigation and screen readers

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Set up Bun project with TypeScript and React
- Create basic project structure and routing
- Implement common UI components

### Phase 2: Data Management
- Implement data types and local storage utilities
- Create custom hooks for data operations
- Build form components with validation

### Phase 3: Page Implementation
- Build individual page components
- Implement navigation between pages
- Add file upload functionality

### Phase 4: Polish and Integration
- Style components for consistent UI
- Add error handling and loading states
- Test all user flows and fix issues
